This requires an up to date browser. The Python that runs here is a bit different to \"normal\" Python, so keep that in mind if you're trying to write your own code here.\n\nMost of the notebook is instructions and quiz questions, but there is also a bit of Python code if you're interested in how to access the data programatically. Knowing and using Python is not necessary to follow most of this tutorial.\n\n<div style=\"background: #d0debb; padding: 16px; border-radius: 4px; margin: 8px\">\nTo use this notebook, click the <b>Run</b> menu at the top, and then <b>Run all cells</b>.\n</div>\n\nYou can also run individual cells using the Play icon at the top, or type shift-enter in any cell to run it.\n\nFor help, contact `sandyr@ebi.ac.uk`\n\n---\n\n# Part 1: Exploring MGnify Studies\n## Task 1.1: Search for a MGnify study\n\nGo to the [MGnify website](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics), and **use the \"Text Search\" feature to search for studies of marine sediment collected using an \"ROV\" (that's a _remote operated vehicle_) from the Environmental > Aquatic > Marine > Sediment biome.**\n\n_Hint: the use of an ROV is only mentioned in the study description, there is no specific metadata field for this._",

Were all of the sequencing runs targetting the 16s SSU region, so designed to barcode bacteria?\n2. Were the primers used likely to sequence the same taxa across all samples?\n\n<details>\n<summary>Tell me</summary>\nThe study description and publication mention that all samples were prepared with primers targetting SSUs, but that some were targetting 16s and some 18s. This means that it <b>is</b> fair to be only using the SSU taxonomic analysis summary across the study. However, it also mentions that some samples were prepared with primers specific to archaea, so there is likely a bias to different taxa in different samples. (In fact, a few different primers were used as can be seen by digging further into the metadata of the study, samples and publication.)
